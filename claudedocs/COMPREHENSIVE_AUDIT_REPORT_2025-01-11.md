## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization Vulnerabilities**
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Unauthorized access, data breaches

- **Missing Route Guards**: Protected routes lack server-side validation
- **Client Portal Security**: Weak token validation in invite system
- **Role-Based Access Control**: No user type distinction (potential privilege escalation)
- **Edge Function Security**: Admin privileges need stricter validation

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Implement authentication guards for all protected routes
- [ ] Add server-side token validation for client portal
- [ ] Create role-based access control system
- [ ] Audit and fix Supabase RLS policies

### 2. **Type Safety Violations**
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Runtime errors, unpredictable behavior

- **41 ESLint errors** with `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
- **React Hooks violations** in SessionGuard.tsx (conditional hooks)
- **Missing dependencies** in useEffect arrays

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Replace all `any` types with proper interfaces
- [ ] Fix React Hooks rule violations
- [ ] Add missing useEffect dependencies

### 3. **Database Security & Performance**
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Data loss, performance degradation

- **No Backup Strategy**: Major operational risk
- **JSON Anti-Pattern**: Tasks/notes in JSON limit query capabilities
- **N+1 Query Problems**: Individual client lookups for each project
- **Missing RLS Policies**: Client portal access not secured

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Implement automated backup strategy
- [ ] Normalize task storage from JSON to proper tables
- [ ] Fix N+1 queries with proper joins
- [ ] Review and strengthen RLS policies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. **Architecture Complexity**
**Impact**: Maintainability, testing difficulty

- **ProjectContext**: 629 lines violating Single Responsibility Principle
- **Complex State Management**: Deeply nested context providers cause re-render cascades
- **Memory Management**: Unbounded arrays, potential memory leaks

### 2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
**Impact**: User experience, mobile performance

- **Bundle Size**: 1.47MB total (main chunk 406KB exceeds 250KB limit)
- **Missing Memoization**: Dashboard recalculates on every render
- **Over-fetching**: SELECT * patterns, unnecessary data loading

### 3. **Error Handling Inconsistency**
**Impact**: User experience, crash scenarios

- **Silent Failures**: Emergency fallbacks mask real problems
- **Race Conditions**: Session management has async conflicts
- **No Error Monitoring**: Production errors not tracked
